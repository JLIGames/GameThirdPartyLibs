\subsection{Detailed Description}
Contains helper structures to handle textures in \hyperlink{class_assimp}{Assimp}.

Used for file formats which embed their textures into the model file. Supported are both normal textures, which are stored as uncompressed pixels, and \char`\"{}compressed\char`\"{} textures, which are stored in a file format such as P\+N\+G or T\+G\+A.
