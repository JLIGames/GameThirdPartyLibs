The assets found in this folder are copied from the Ogre3\+D S\+D\+K samples.

This asset set is used to test the full functionality of both binary and X\+M\+L \hyperlink{class_assimp}{Assimp} scene import of the Ogre mesh and skeleton file formats and in addition the text based material parser.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Binary mesh and skeleton files have not been modified.
\item X\+M\+L mesh and skeleton files were produced from the binary versions with the {\ttfamily Ogre\+X\+M\+L\+Converter} tool.
\item Material file was created by copying the relevant material parts from the sample sources. See the file for further information.
\item Some textures were converted from .png to .jpg to reduce the file size.
