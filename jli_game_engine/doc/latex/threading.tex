This page discusses both assimps scalability in threaded environments and the precautions to be taken in order to use it from multiple threads concurrently.\hypertarget{threading_threadsafety}{}\section{Thread-\/safety / using Assimp concurrently from several threads}\label{threading_threadsafety}
The library can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, as long as the following prerequisites are fulfilled\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Users of the C++-\/\+A\+P\+I should ensure that they use a dedicated \hyperlink{class_assimp_1_1_importer}{Assimp\+::\+Importer} instance for each thread. Constructing instances of \hyperlink{class_assimp_1_1_importer}{Assimp\+::\+Importer} is expensive, so it might be a good idea to let every thread maintain its own thread-\/local instance (which can be used to load as many files as necessary).
\item The C-\/\+A\+P\+I is thread safe.
\item When supplying custom I\+O logic, one must make sure the underlying implementation is thread-\/safe.
\item Custom log streams or logger replacements have to be thread-\/safe, too.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Multiple concurrent imports may or may not be beneficial, however. For certain file formats in conjunction with little or no post processing I\+O times tend to be the performance bottleneck. Intense post processing together with 'slow' file formats like X or Collada might scale well with multiple concurrent imports.\hypertarget{threading_automt}{}\section{Internal threading}\label{threading_automt}
\hyperlink{struct_internal}{Internal} multi-\/threading is not currently implemented.
