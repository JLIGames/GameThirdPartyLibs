Open Asset Import Library is a Open Source library designed to load various {\bfseries 3d file formats and convert them into a shared, in-\/memory format}. It supports more than {\bfseries 30 file formats} for import and a growing selection of file formats for export. Additionally, assimp features various {\bfseries post processing tools} to refine the imported data\+: {\itshape normals and tangent space generation, triangulation, vertex cache locality optimization, removal of degenerate primitives and duplicate vertices, sorting by primitive type, merging of redundant materials} and many more.

This is the development trunk of assimp containing the latest features and bugfixes. For productive use though, we recommend one of the stable releases available from \href{http://assimp.sf.net}{\tt assimp.\+sf.\+net} or from $\ast$nix package repositories. According to \href{https://travis-ci.org/}{\tt Travis-\/\+C\+I}, the current build status of the trunk is \href{https://travis-ci.org/assimp/assimp}{\tt !\mbox{[}Build Status\mbox{]}(https\+://travis-\/ci.\+org/assimp/assimp.\+png)}

\paragraph*{Supported file formats}

The library provides importers for a lot of file formats, including\+:

Exporters include\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item D\+A\+E (Collada)
\item S\+T\+L
\item O\+B\+J
\item P\+L\+Y
\item J\+S\+O\+N (for Web\+Gl, via \href{https://github.com/acgessler/assimp2json}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/acgessler/assimp2json})

\paragraph*{Repository structure}

Open Asset Import Library is implemented in C++ (but provides both a C and a C++ish interface). The directory structure is\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}/bin        Folder for binaries, only used on Windows
/code       Source code
/contrib    Third-party libraries
/doc        Documentation (doxysource and pre-compiled docs)
/include    Public header C and C++ header files
/lib        Static library location for Windows
/obj        Object file location for Windows
/scripts    Scripts used to generate the loading code for some formats
/port       Ports to other languages and scripts to maintain those.
/test       Unit- and regression tests, test suite of models
/tools      Tools (viewer, command line `assimp`)
/samples    A small number of samples to illustrate possible 
                    use cases for Assimp
/workspaces Build enviroments for vc,xcode,... (deprecated,
        CMake has superseeded all legacy build options!)
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsubsection*{Building}

Take a look into the {\ttfamily I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L} file. Our build system is C\+Make, if you already used C\+Make before there is a good chance you know what to do.

\subsubsection*{Where to get help}

For more information, visit \href{http://assimp.sourceforge.net/}{\tt our website}. Or check out the {\ttfamily ./doc}-\/ folder, which contains the official documentation in H\+T\+M\+L format. (C\+H\+Ms for Windows are included in some release packages and should be located right here in the root folder).

If the documentation doesn't solve your problems, \href{http://sourceforge.net/p/assimp/discussion/817654}{\tt try our forums at S\+F.\+net} or ask on \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/assimp?sort=newest}{\tt Stack\+Overflow}.

For development discussions, there is also a mailing list, {\itshape assimp-\/discussions} \href{https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/assimp-discussions}{\tt (subscribe here)}

\subsubsection*{Contributing}

Contributions to assimp are highly appreciated. The easiest way to get involved is to submit a pull request with your changes against the main repository's {\ttfamily master} branch.

\subsubsection*{License}

Our license is based on the modified, {\bfseries 3-\/clause B\+S\+D}-\/\+License, which is very liberal.

An {\itshape informal} summary is\+: do whatever you want, but include \hyperlink{class_assimp}{Assimp}'s license text with your product -\/ and don't sue us if our code doesn't work. Note that, unlike L\+G\+P\+Led code, you may link statically to \hyperlink{class_assimp}{Assimp}. For the legal details, see the {\ttfamily L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+S\+E} file.
